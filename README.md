# Emotion_Detection_CNN
**CNN-Based Emotion Detection**
**Project Overview**
This project focuses on detecting emotions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model takes facial images as input and predicts the corresponding emotion. It is trained on a dataset of labeled facial images representing various emotions like happy, sad, angry, and neutral.

**Installation**
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

**1. Clone the Repository**
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-detection-cnn.git
cd emotion-detection-cnn
**2. Set up a Python Virtual Environment**
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
**3. Install Required Dependencies**
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file includes all necessary libraries like tensorflow, keras, opencv-python, numpy, and matplotlib.

Usage
1. **Dataset Preparation**
Ensure the dataset is organized in the following structure:

bash
Copy code
/data
    /train
        /happy
        /sad
        /angry
        /neutral
    /test
        /happy
        /sad
        /angry
        /neutral
**2. Training the Model**
To train the CNN model on your dataset, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
This script will train the model using the data located in the data/train/ directory.

**3. Running Inference on New Images**
Once the model is trained, you can run predictions on new images by executing:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains facial images labeled with emotions such as:

Happy
Sad
Angry
Neutral
You can download a pre-existing dataset like FER2013, or use your own labeled images.

Make sure to place the dataset in the data directory with a folder structure as mentioned above.

Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture consists of the following layers:

**Convolutional Layers:** To extract features from the input image.
**MaxPooling Layers:** To downsample the feature maps.
**Fully Connected Layers:** To perform classification based on extracted features.
**Output Layer:** Softmax layer to output probabilities for each emotion class.
**Summary of Layers:**
Conv2D -> ReLU -> MaxPooling
Conv2D -> ReLU -> MaxPooling
Fully Connected -> ReLU
Output Layer (Softmax)
Training
Hyperparameters:
Epochs: 50
Batch Size: 32
Learning Rate: 0.001
Optimizer: Adam
You can modify these hyperparameters in the train.py file to experiment with different configurations.

**Evaluation**
To evaluate the model’s performance on the test dataset, run:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py
This will output metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

**Results**
The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test set, with the following results for each emotion class:

**Emotion	Precision	Recall	F1-Score**
Happy	XX%	XX%	XX%
Sad	XX%	XX%	XX%
Angry	XX%	XX%	XX%
Neutral	XX%	XX%	XX%
